# Turn-Based RPG Game

Welcome to my turn-based RPG game project! This game is a work in progress and currently focuses on the backend logic of the battle system.

## Project Overview

- **Game Type:** Turn-based RPG
- **Status:** Work in progress
- **Assets:** Currently, there are no images, sounds, or assets. The primary focus is on developing the backend logic.

## Development Details

- **Compiler:** The game runs in a compiler from the main file.
- **Debugging:** The code has been altered for debugging purposes and does not reflect the final battle system's stat values and damage values.
- **Framework:** The code has been moved into a framework, and modifications are underway to integrate it properly.

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `core/`: Core game logic
- `android/`: Android-specific code
- `desktop/`: Desktop-specific code
- `ios/`: iOS-specific code

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the main file to start the game.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. Contributions are welcome!

## Notes
