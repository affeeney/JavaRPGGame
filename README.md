# JavaRPGGame
Turn-based RPG game logic implemented in Java. This project currently focuses on the backend game mechanics, including battle sequences and commands. The code, residing in a framework, is a work in progress and has been adjusted for debugging purposes. Please note that the stat values, damage calculations, and other mechanics are NOT final.
